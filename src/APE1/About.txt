Title: foreordination
Started On: 3/4/2011
Summary: Simple doom-like game to test our abilities.
Thoughts: Must not suck.
Closed On: 4/25/11

What we liked: The Unity engine had a lot of power and extendability for multiple platfors, but was too far out of reach for our development community.
What we hated: Unity was complicated/yet another thing to learn and dance around.
What we have learned: Stick with pre-created assets and proven tools (Source/Unreal), keep a very small scope, we need to start small with a definite set of objectives.
